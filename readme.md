[146bpm.com](http://146bpm.com/) Vine loops â†’ polyrhythm drum machine
======================

*In the spirit of [In B Flat](http://inbflat.net/)...*

I experimented to get the loop close to looping, but it is going to be a messed up polyrhythm without some player control. At least in Chrome on my computer a 416.875ms beat is close (6570ms video + 100ms looping lag / 16 beats). If Vine changes the video length in a future version it will mess things up.

Vine feature requests: WebM version for Firefox, easy way to embed &lt;video&gt; for more syncing and control, easier way to get link from app...
